.Sh NAME
.Nm rcrecv
.Nd driver for gpio based RF receivers
.Sh SYNOPSIS
To load the driver as a module at boot time, place the following line in
.Xr loader.conf 5 :
.Bd -literal -offset indent
rcrecv_load="YES"
.Ed
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Nm
device driver provides support for the GPIO based radio receivers. It creates
a character device
.Pa /dev/rcrecv
reading from which returns a last received hexadecimal code as a string. Also it
provides a couple of ioctl calls:
.Pp
.Bl -bullet -compact
.It
RCRECV_READ_CODE;
.It
RCRECV_READ_CODE_INFO
.El
.Pp
These calls returns codes as
.Vt unsigned int
and
.Vt struct rcrecv_code
respectively and, after the driver is installed, can be accessed with following
headers file
.Pa /usr/local/include/dev/rcrecv/rcrecv.h
.Pp
The driver determines that a sequence of radio pulses may contain a code by
analyzing a series of the same code sent by the remote control when the button
is held down for a while. After the driver extracts the code from the sequence,
it generates
.Xr poll 2
or
.Xr kqueue 2
events if requested by the user software.
.Pp
Reliable identification of the code may require 3 or
more retransmitted code sequences.
.Pp
The driver provides several new variables available with the
.Xr sysctl 8
utility that reflect the current state of the RF receiver:
.Bd -literal
dev.rcrecv.%d.tolerance: 60
dev.rcrecv.%d.pulse_duration: 326
dev.rcrecv.%d.proto: 1
dev.rcrecv.%d.bit_length: 24
dev.rcrecv.%d.value: 9776792
dev.rcrecv.%d.last_time: 1422135711828
dev.rcrecv.%d.%parent: simplebus0
dev.rcrecv.%d.%pnpinfo: name=rcrecv@0 compat=rcrecv
dev.rcrecv.%d.%location:
dev.rcrecv.%d.%driver: rcrecv
dev.rcrecv.%d.%desc: GPIO Remote Control Receiver module
.Ed
.Sh SYSCTL VARIABLES
The following variables are available:
.Bl -tag -width indent
.It Va dev.rcrecv.%d.proto
Detected transfer protocol number;
.It Va dev.rcrecv.%d.pulse_duration
Calculated nominal pulse duration for the detected protocol. The actual pulse
widths for the protocol are multiples of this nominal value and are given as a
factor in the transmission protocol list
.Va static protocol proto[] .

See
.Pa /usr/local/include/dev/rcrecv/rcrecv.h
for details;
.It Va dev.rcrecv.%d.tolerance
Percentage of tolerance of the durations of the received pulses from the
durations specified for the detected transmission protocol;
.It Va dev.rcrecv.%d.value
The last received code value;
.It Va dev.rcrecv.%d.bit_length
Bit length of the received code;
